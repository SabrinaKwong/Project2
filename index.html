    <em>Find Peace</em> is part of the two-part series of <em>Body Vessels</em> :"The Human Body: A Restorative Vessel" and serves as a teaching and mindulness web piece to how our bodies are capable of healing. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This piece explores the concepts of healing with somatics in a technological way. 3-d scans of  bodies showing different positions of QiGong were brought into Maya and using A-frames as a vessel to bring awareness of how our bodies are capable of growth and change during stressful times. The users interaction with the art work on screen with the VR view-port are representations navigating one's healing journey through QiGong and acts of healing practices. In viewing od the bodies of 3-D space, one notices the different lying body postures as well as the plants that surrond them. They serve as a source of energy when one is receiving the energy of natural elements. Where the posture of lying down, "qi Collection", is being practiced while the viewer is learning about the differnt ways to natural healing states. Inspired by the natural elements found in receiving energy from nature, specifically QiGong.
